                    <dt>Describe how you construct the LAN step by step in detail and in order. In order to show the
                    detail of each step, for example, you need to describe which port of the switch you used, which
                    network protocol you used, etc. You can take some snapshots of the screen to facilitate your
                    description. It is expected that within current settings anyone (even without any knowledge of
                    network) can construct a LAN by referring to your report. Take pictures of how you connect
                    cSection Two: Creating Ethernet Cablesomputers to routers, clearly show the ports used in connection and a whole of the setting.
                    MSection Two: Creating Ethernet Cablesake sure the cables you made in Lab 4 is visible in the picture.</dt>
                    <ul>To create a LAN, perform the following in order:
                        <li>Verify you have at a minimum two computers, one switch/router, and two ethernet cables.</li>
                        <li>Plug in the ethernet cords to the computer in the ethernet port, then connect the other ends into the router.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the command line, (for Unix) type in ipconfig</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <dt>After the LAN is constructed, describe how you share the file in detailed steps. For example,
                        which folder is shared, which user can access the shared folder, how you set the access
                        privileges, etc. It is expected that anyone can share his/her files to selected users by referring to
                        your report.</dt>
